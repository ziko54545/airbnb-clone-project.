## Technology Stack

This project uses a modern set of technologies to build a complete and efficient application.  
Below are the main technologies and their purpose:

### 1. Django
A high-level Python web framework.  
It is used to develop secure and scalable web applications and to build RESTful APIs for handling business logic.

### 2. PostgreSQL
A powerful relational database management system.  
It is used to store and manage structured data with strong support for complex queries, high performance, and scalability.

### 3. GraphQL
A query language for APIs.  
It allows clients to request exactly the data they need from the server, improving performance and reducing the number of requests.

### 4. React (if mentioned in the project)
A JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.  
It is used to create dynamic, component-based frontends that connect seamlessly with APIs.
## Database Design

The database for this project is structured to manage users, properties, bookings, reviews, and payments efficiently.  
Below are the key entities and their main fields:

### 1. Users
- *id*: Unique identifier for each user  
- *name*: Full name of the user  
- *email*: User’s email address  
- *password*: Hashed password for authentication  
- *role*: Role of the user (e.g., admin, customer, property owner)  

### 2. Properties
- *id*: Unique identifier for each property  
- *owner_id*: References the user who owns the property  
- *title*: Name or title of the property  
- *description*: Description of the property  
- *location*: Address or location details  

### 3. Bookings
- *id*: Unique booking identifier  
- *user_id*: References the user who made the booking  
- *property_id*: References the booked property  
- *start_date*: Booking start date  
- *end_date*: Booking end date  

### 4. Reviews
- *id*: Unique review identifier  
- *user_id*: References the user who wrote the review  
- *property_id*: References the reviewed property  
- *rating*: Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5 stars)  
- *comment*: User’s written review  

### 5. Payments
- *id*: Unique payment identifier  
- *booking_id*: References the related booking  
- *amount*: Payment amount  
- *status*: Payment status (e.g., completed, pending)  
- *payment_date*: Date of the payment  

### Relationships
- A *user* can own multiple *properties*.  
- A *user* can make multiple *bookings*.  
- Each *booking* belongs to one *property* and one *user*.  
- A *property* can have multiple *reviews* from different users.  
- Each *booking* is associated with one *payment*.  
## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.  
This feature ensures that each user has a secure and personalized experience, with roles that define access to different parts of the application.

### 2. Property Management
Enables property owners to list, edit, and delete their properties.  
It includes detailed information such as location, description, photos, and availability, making it easy for users to explore and book properties.

### 3. Booking System
Facilitates the reservation of properties by users.  
It handles booking creation, date selection, availability checks, and ensures that bookings do not conflict with existing reservations.

### 4. Reviews and Ratings
Allows users to leave feedback on properties they have stayed at.  
This feature improves trust and transparency, helping future users make informed decisions.

### 5. Payment System
Manages secure transactions between users and property owners.  
It supports payment processing, status tracking, and ensures financial data is handled safely.

## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is crucial to protect user data and ensure safe transactions. Key security measures include:

- *Authentication*: Verifies user identity using tokens or sessions, ensuring only legitimate users can access the system.  
- *Authorization*: Controls user access to different resources based on roles (e.g., admin, property owner, guest).  
- *Rate Limiting*: Prevents abuse of APIs by limiting the number of requests per user or IP address.  
- *Data Encryption*: Sensitive information like passwords and payment details are encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.  

These measures protect user privacy, secure payments, and prevent malicious attacks.

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code.  
They ensure that new features and bug fixes are delivered safely and quickly without manual intervention.  

Tools that can be used include:  
- *GitHub Actions*: Automates testing and deployment workflows.  
- *Docker*: Provides consistent environments for building and running applications.  
- *Jenkins / GitLab CI*: Alternative CI/CD tools to manage pipelines and deployments.  

CI/CD pipelines improve development efficiency, reduce errors, and maintain high-quality standards throughout the project lifecycle.
